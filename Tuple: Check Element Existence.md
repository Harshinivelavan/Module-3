# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 1, 5, 8, 'z')

has_n = 'n' in x

has_8 = 8 in x


print("Is 'n' in the tuple?", has_n)
print("Is 8 in the tuple?", has_8)

~~~
